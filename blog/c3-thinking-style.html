          <h1>Thinking According to Gregorc</h1>
          <h4>April 2nd 2015</h4>
          <hr>

    <!-- Research your thinking style and consider how you can use your understanding of your thinking style to your advantage at DBC to help you learn.
   
    Reflect on your experience in Phase 0 to this point. What has been the biggest struggle for you? Is it related to the way you think and learn or is it related to something else? If it's related to your learning style, start thinking of strategies to help you. Put some plans of action in place.
   
   Now, contemplate the idea of growth vs. fixed mindset. Part of knowing about your thinking styles is to know what you need to learn effectively, but we also want to encourage you to broaden the ways you learn and think. Our learning and thinking styles can morph and change as we exercise our brains. So think of some ways you can work to expand the ways you learn and think. The more well-rounded you are, the easier it will be to learn quickly and effectively. -->

          Thoughts are a tangled mess of concepts often connceted in labyrinthine fashion. It takes effort to deconvolute. Peep my progess in learning about how the Internet works <a href="../img/the_internet_040415.svg">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
          It is my opinion that learning has to do with mirroring the actual word in one's mind. 
          </p>
          <p>
          That may sound a bit 'space-agey', but I think it true nonetheless. When an image is imagined you can "see" it, right? When remeniscing about some sensation, you can "feel" it, right? Learning to me then is nothing more than 'hard-wiring' one's experience. That is, capturing said experence in one or another part(s) of the brain to be accessed whenever. You often hear that there are many ways people learn. The so-called "kinetic learner" learns best by doing and the "aural" appreciates learning through hearing. I think this notion true insofar as the modes of learning represent a sensitivity or preference (or both) to the encoding information streaming from the sensory organs. Personally I am sensitive to and prefer information in multiple formats. The advantage to this strategy is that I somthing learned is not easily forgotten as it is deeply associated with my person. The drawback is that I often have to learn things multiple times! Recently I took a test that corroborates this. 
          </p>
          <h3>The Gregorc Test</h3>
          <p>
          Before we get further into learning styles, a bit of motivation. I fancy myself serious about using the scientific method. One observes something happening, guesses what causes it, tests the guess, and evaluates the results of the test. Repeat as necessary. To use this tried and true method, one has to be able to think abstractly--i.e. conceive what they have yet to experience--in order to "guess" why some phenomena occurs. Then they've got to have the discipline to plan and run an experiment. Easy in prose tougher in practice. Anyhow, I enjoy this process. I took this <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">test</a> and it suggested what I already knew: that I am an abstract thinker that likes  experimentation. How else does one deliberately learn things?  
          </p>
          <h3>My Preferred Learning Styles</h3>
          <p>
          I like to learn through many different channels to create a robust understanding that can take hold regardless of my environment. My preferred modes are the visual, kinetic, and aural. Preferring these different modes requires that I learn something through each of them. Instead of learning a concept three times, I have adapted a peculiar mannerism. I will actually speak (or whisper--even more creepy, right?!) a concept while animating it with my hands. I won't make eye-contact because, in my head, I'm imagining the concept in action. While it's a bit socially awkward, I attribute my ability to quickly grasp complex ideas to this quirk. As a <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/learn-ruby-javascript/overview/">DBC</a> student, I actually am not a fan of the 'homework-y' fell phase 0 has! Hate is a strong word, but I have an aversion to endless task lists. Reading text is unnatural and very computational intensive, in my opinion. Being in the presence of skilled professionals gives a clearer picture of what to approach and how to do it.

          I'm done writing for now, but will revisit this topic later. There's much more emotion here than I expected.
