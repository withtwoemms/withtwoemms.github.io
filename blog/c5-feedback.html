        <h1>Give it to me straight</h1>
        <h2>Honesty is the best policy when giving feedback</h2>
        <h4>April 23rd 2015</h4>
        <hr>
          <p>
          I am the type of person that believes in honesty. The universe is honest and to reciprocate that characteristic is the least we could do. In my years though, I've come to know people for whom honesty is not an instinct&mdash;myself included. Not that we are charlatans or criminals, there are those, but dishonest when it comes to giving or receiving criticism. To shield the ego, there are many-a sheepish smile given in lieu of genuinine evaluation. "Sparing" each other the "harsh" reality is a disservice. I would rather set my feelings aside and digest some feedback so that I may incorporate whatever useful bits into progressing towards my best self.  
          </p>
          <h3>On pair programming</h3>
          <p>
          In my opinion, it works best when partners are frank with each other. The pairing process usually starts with some "hello"s and a bit of "butt-sniffing" (usually in an attempt to establish dominance for which there is no need :) before the pair awkwardly dives in to putting fingers to keys. I attribute the butt-sniffing and the general awkwardness to fear: fear of possibly revealing to one's compatriot that they are sub-par. Maybe this some manifestation of the infamous "imposter's syndrome". If so, it need not be. The question that comes to mind is this: "<em>What's to be gained from ridiculing or ostrasizing one's partner?</em>". If the goal is to foster change on your team then making your partnership a safe space for expressions is important.
          </p>
          <h3>On feedback</h3>
          <p>
          Sure, one may want their partner to just magically 'be better' or to slow down a bit, but bullying has less desireable outcomes than does gentle honesty. Straightforwardly expressing one's concerns is the b.s.-free way of enciting change. This direct way of communicating is good when both parties are each confident in themselves and their ability to make use of feedback. IRL, though, confidence is not as abundant. This is where the "gentle" part comes in. Being congnisant of someone's insecurities surrounding that for which you are about to critique can help to shape the way in which the critique is given. No specefics here. Feel it out in your own scenario and don't be an asshole.
