          <h1>The Science of CSS</h1>
          <h2>A bit on the <em>Visual Formatting Model</em> & <em>Positioning Schemes</em></h2>
          <h4>March 29th, 2015</h4>
          <hr>
          <p>
          The use of <em>cascading style sheets</em>--CSS--makes implementing styles for many pages, much easier than it otherwise would be. Rather than changing the stylings on each individual page, they can be changed in one .css file and rendered accordingly on each page. The initialism, CSS, includes the term <em>cascade</em> in reference to the way child elements inherit properties from their parents. While the concept of the cascade is fairly straightforward, how it works in practice can be the source of much frustration. Sometimes properties that should cascade: do not, and those that should not: do. This leads a unexpected stylings and positionings. To take control of your DOM's style, the <em><b>Visual Formatting Model</b></em> must be discussed.
          </p>
          <p>
          The Visual Formatting Model is a parsing algorithm written about at length <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Visual_formatting_model">here</a> and <a href="http://www.tutorialrepublic.com/css-tutorial/css-visual-formatting.php">here</a>. The VFM is instituted by the browser which renders a <em>box</em> for each element in the DOM. The box wraps the content--i.e. the text between tags--and through the use of the style tag or attrbute, the way element boxes are rendered can be controlled. The use of stylesheet is an abstracted and surrogate way of doing this. In the majority of CSS applications, there are three main levers of control available: the type of box, the dimensions of the box, and the <em>positioning scheme</em> of the box.
          <p>
          Before considering what impacts how a box is rendered, an explanation is in order. The anatomy of a box is neatly given below:
          <img src="https://www.goshen.edu/physix/326/cssbox/3d-box-model.png">
          Content is text and it is wrapped by a border. That border can be separated from the content by distance called <em>padding</em>. The background of an element refers to the space within the border boundary. The las aspect of a box is the <em>margin</em>. The margin clears the space between its boundaries and the border. There you have it: "the anatomy of a box" ... moving on...
          </p>
          <p>
          Boxes can be displayed as either <em>inline</em>- or <em>block</em>-level elements. Inline display of an  element is the most natural in that it resembles text in a word processor. An element is rendered "in line" with the text thus negating any specified height attribute. The width of an inline element is still determinable using the "width" attribute". Unlike the inline element the block element is rendered with line breaks on either side (left and right) and so displaces inline elements. The dimensions of the block element are fully tunable. To make a box that responds to text-control attributes (i.e. "text-align") and still has the full dimensional control, a box may be displayed as an <em>inline-block</em> element.  
          </p>
          <p>
          Now that the box and how it can be displayed have been described it would be useful to cover how to position it. A <em>positioning scheme</em> governs how placement of the box is done--one or another may be useful depending on the desired effect. There are three schemes. The default is the <em>normal flow</em> boxes are rendered sequentially within their container. Next is the <em>float</em> scheme wherein a box within some containing box (more on containers another day) is said to have been 'floated' out of the container. 'Floated' boxes exist alongside their containers. Then there is the <em>absolute</em> positioning scheme. In the absolute scheme, the box is no longer within the flow and so does not interact an boxes within the flow. 
          </p>
          <p>
          I don't care if I've convinced you at this point, but there is a 'rhyme and reason' to CSS styling. Issues, frustration, and tedium usually come from a confusion or mixing of positioning schemes, display styles, or both. More of the pitfalls and contradictions later.
