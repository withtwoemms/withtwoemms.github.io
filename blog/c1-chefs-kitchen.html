  <h1>So I'm a 'Dev Bootcamper' now</h1>
  <h2>What that means and how I feel about it</h2>
  <h4>March 22nd 2015</h4>
  <hr>
          <p>
    I am excited about <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/learn-ruby-javascript/overview/">Dev bootcamp</a>. What I care most about is what I call the <em>agnostic stuff</em>. I look foward to knowing the best practices in databising information and delivering it to users. The MVC (model, view, controller) paradigm is central in that pursuit. Algorithms also interest me. I want to use the massive resource that are DBC instructors and fellow students to build incarnations of regression algorithms like recommendation engines that aid decision-making in 'big data' applications.
          </p>
          <h3>Any expectations?</h3>
          <p>
    I imagine this experience like one of those old martial arts movies: me a 'grasshopper' seeking guidance from a wise and white-bearded sensei. I am not afraid of the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin">beginner's mind</a>". I live in it. I have so many notions about how different programming concepts can be pieced together. This is the reason I decided to join DBC: to see what the limit of those posibilities is. Learning the limits will entrain my creativity towards productive programming. When it comes to fellow students in the dojo, I hope to train hard and 'spar' with them--hopefully over beers.
          </p>
          <h3>How do I envision my involvement?</h3>
          <p>
    To my fellow bootcampers: please be prepared to hear me ask very obscure questions. I don't ask about whether a single staged file can be 'hard reset' to fluff my feathers, I ask because I genuinely want to know. To that end I am preparing a robust system, toolset, and workflow so I won't be afraid of breaking things (and so can avoid asking those obscure questions :). I am still nonetheless very curious about how <em>all</em> the piecies fit together. I believe that if I know web development in an agnostic sense then I will be able to apply it to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_programming">systems programming</a>. I will endeavor to be helpful where I can, but that while kind, I am in this to learn. I will pursue social engagment through intellectual pursuit.
