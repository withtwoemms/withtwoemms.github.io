        <h1>"Diversity" is <em>Listening</em></h1>
        <h4>April 12th 2015</h4>

          Race in America gets political. We know that. This habit of Gerrymandering and the history of Jim Crow tells us so. The fight to assert influence on the identity of the US of A, seems forever one between racial minorities vs. the majority. This is healthy. It is also necessary, in my opinion, as this country continuously stives towards that asymtote described by its fore-fathers: that "..All [people] are created equal".

          <p>
          What interests me though is the motivation for political equality. We'll save dignity and courtesy paid to one's fellow human for another discussion, but in this motivation I discern a maybe less obvious notion. The notion that political power is intricately tied to economic power. I'm sure tons of folk more educated on the topic have written about it before this, but allow me to belabor the point. I consider our political institutions forums for consensus on how resouces belonging to 'the collective' are allocated. We all work very had at whatever it is we do, and the ultimate result is the transformation of raw materials into useful goods that keep us alive [and some]. This is a straightforward idea, albeit nuanced. The nuance creeps in with the natural questions that arise such as "What raw materials should be used?" and "How should they be used?". I submit that it is to answer these basic quesions that the <em>body politic</em> exists: decisions must be made.

          As we all know, the American brand of democracy (as well as those of other leading world nations) exists as a Republic and so afords citizens an indirect control over decision-making by granting direct control over installing (and uninstalling if need be..) those individuals responsible for making decisions. Demographically speaking, it's a numbers' game. Whichever group is vying for a certain mode of resouce allocation can elect an individual that will [hopefully] make decisions on their behalf. We should not be surprised that this is a culturally- and, resultantly, racially-charged process. Folks of different cultures have different ideals and ideas about what raw materials are important and how they should be used. Understandable. In this field of possible decisions regarding resource allocation, let's suppose some to be optimally profitable&#9742;i.e. ways of using resources that benifit the widest range of people. We can debate the definition of the "optimal" and "profitable" some other time (feel free to shout <a href="https://twitter.com/withtwoemms">@withtwoemms</a> on twitter). For now, let's stick with the supposition...

          Let's agree that all people anywhere should exercise their right to vote if that privilege is available. It's what you do. Here in The States, we do a fairly decent job of voting. Ever since the Jiggy Era of rap, voter turnout for Presidential elections have consistently been over 50%. The mid-term (<a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/why-are-midterm-elections-important-whats-stake-2014-election-1718463">arguably more important</a>) elections: <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/24/voter-turnout-always-drops-off-for-midterm-elections-but-why/">not so much</a>. One tid-bit I'm personally proud of is that minorities in the relative......
