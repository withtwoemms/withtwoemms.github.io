  <h2>My first learnings in the ways of git</h2>
  <h4>March 22nd 2015</h4>
  <hr>
    <p>
      I have limited experience with git, but am beginning to unravel it's inner workings. So then begins my wrestiling with this prolific command line tool...

    <h3>What is change tracking?</h3>
    <p>
    Software is a set of instructions for a machine. These instructions are simply written in text. Getting the machine to do as one says can be complicated so there are agreed upon ways of writing these instructions. It is this special way of writing the instructions that we know as <em>code</em>. As one goes through the ardor of writing good instructions, the text changes. If the text is code that governs machine behavior, then it would be nice to be aware of any change made. That way, the developer can know what in the code is causing a given behavior. Thankfully and down from the heavens of the Linux Foundation comes <strong><a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics">git</a></strong>. Git is what is called a <em>version control system</em> (VCS) and it is a tool that automatically tracks changes in the code (how it does this is food for another thought..).
    <h3>So what do you mean by <em>version</em>?</h3>
    </p>
    A <em>version</em> of software is just the state of the code at a given time. Literally speaking, the "version of software" refers to the state of its text. By using git to track this state, the developer can keep up with and organize the different behaviors the software endows. No one wants to introduce an unintended misbehavior into their software (a.k.a. a "bug"). So every time the developer writes some code that does gives the correct result (after thorough testing of course :), the many changes that were made can be saved using git and the developer now has a working version of their code. Making code work, especially for a complicated application, is no small feat and developers tend not to be flippant about making new versions, but rather committed. Conveniently, git calls the saving of a version a <em>commit</em> and stores a history of them.
    <h3>How can I use version history to my advantage?</h3>
    <p>
    ...for the answer to that question, tune in next time!
